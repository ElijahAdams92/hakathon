Vanguard provides an extensive set of investment products and services to individual investors, institutions, employer-sponsored retirement plans, and financial professionals. Vanguard is known for competitive investment performance, a broad array of funds, top client service, and costs that are among the industry’s lowest. <br><br>Most investment firms are either publicly traded or privately owned. Vanguard is different: It is owned by the Vanguard funds, which are in turn owned by their clients. Helping Vanguard investors achieve their goals is the firm’s sole reason for existence. With no other parties to answer to and therefore no conflicting loyalties, Vanguard makes every decision—including the decision to keep investing costs as low as possible—with only its clients’ needs in mind.<br><br>Vanguard is recognized frequently as an employer of choice and for its comprehensive total rewards package of compensation, benefits, and work–life programs. The Company has more than 14,500 employees (referred to as “crew members” in keeping with Vanguard’s nautical theme) in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania; Charlotte, North Carolina; and Scottsdale, Arizona as well as Australia, the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, Canada and five other countries. Its investment philosophy of long-term focus and diversification extends to its employees as well. Vanguard is highly selective in hiring at the outset, and then invests significantly in each crew member’s development, focusing on cultivating his or her managerial and strategic capabilities. The result is a collaborative environment where measurable goals are set and delivered upon by teams of highly committed professionals. <br><br>Department Overview<br>Vanguard’s Organizational Consulting Services (OCS) group is a team of consultants helping senior executives (Managing Directors and their direct reports) consider and respond to the most pressing issues impacting Vanguard’s growth and success. In response to both market and internal challenges, OCS helps drive change initiatives to enact the corporate vision, improve business activities, drive efficiency and establish new business segments.<p></p><p></p><p>The Transformation Consultant engages with Vanguard executives to help them consider how to address these issues. These interactions generally result in a variety of OCS-led initiatives including business or department redesign, enterprise-wide transformation, and major project support.
