Vanguard provides an extensive set of investment products and services to individual investors, institutions, employer-sponsored retirement plans, and financial professionals. Vanguard is known for competitive investment performance, a broad array of funds, top client service, and costs that are among the industry’s lowest. &lt;br>&lt;br>Most investment firms are either publicly traded or privately owned. Vanguard is different: It is owned by the Vanguard funds, which are in turn owned by their clients. Helping Vanguard investors achieve their goals is the firm’s sole reason for existence. With no other parties to answer to and therefore no conflicting loyalties, Vanguard makes every decision—including the decision to keep investing costs as low as possible—with only its clients’ needs in mind.&lt;br>&lt;br>Vanguard is recognized frequently as an employer of choice and for its comprehensive total rewards package of compensation, benefits, and work–life programs. The Company has more than 14,500 employees (referred to as “crew members” in keeping with Vanguard’s nautical theme) in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania; Charlotte, North Carolina; and Scottsdale, Arizona as well as Australia, the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, Canada and five other countries. Its investment philosophy of long-term focus and diversification extends to its employees as well. Vanguard is highly selective in hiring at the outset, and then invests significantly in each crew member’s development, focusing on cultivating his or her managerial and strategic capabilities. The result is a collaborative environment where measurable goals are set and delivered upon by teams of highly committed professionals. &lt;br>&lt;br>Department Overview&lt;br>Vanguard’s Organizational Consulting Services (OCS) group is a team of consultants helping senior executives (Managing Directors and their direct reports) consider and respond to the most pressing issues impacting Vanguard’s growth and success. In response to both market and internal challenges, OCS helps drive change initiatives to enact the corporate vision, improve business activities, drive efficiency and establish new business segments.&lt;p>&lt;/p>&lt;p>&lt;/p>&lt;p>The Transformation Consultant engages with Vanguard executives to help them consider how to address these issues. These interactions generally result in a variety of OCS-led initiatives including business or department redesign, enterprise-wide transformation, and major project support. The Transformation Consultant will lead or serve as a key member of the teams that deliver these projects.&lt;/p>&lt;p>&lt;/p>&lt;p>&lt;i>&lt;b>&lt;i>&lt;b>Key Duties &amp;amp; Responsibilities&lt;/b>&lt;/i>&lt;/b> &lt;/i>&lt;/p>&lt;ul>&lt;li>Work with clients to assess the best-fit organization or operating model to ensure the business is positioned to execute its strategy and meet its stated goals&lt;/li>&lt;li>Conduct current state organizational assessments to isolate strengths, challenges and opportunities to improve organization in response to evolving business strategies or environments&lt;/li>&lt;li>Generate hypotheses to improve clients’ operating models, org structures and test hypotheses via a blend of qualitative analysis (e.g., client interviews) and quantitative analysis (e.g., spans and layers)&lt;/li>&lt;li>Develop data-driven recommendations for future-state organization designs and associated enablers (e.g., decision rights, critical behaviors)&lt;/li>&lt;li>Facilitate client group discussions on how to improve organizational effectiveness (e.g., ways of working, visioning sessions) and provide real-time consultation on potential solutions.&lt;/li>&lt;li>Provide short-term, focused consultations to business leaders on common organizational and change-related challenges.&lt;/li>&lt;li>Lead the specific elements (e.g., change management work stream, organizational analysis) of larger business transformation efforts and develop and deliver impactful, cohesive, and comprehensive recommendations.&lt;/li>&lt;li>Assist in the development of transformation structures, approaches and work plans.&lt;/li>&lt;li>Independently lead engagements of appropriate size, scope, and complexity.&lt;/li>&lt;li>Collaborate with OCS colleagues, HR partners, and stakeholders across Vanguard to develop effective and coordinated approaches to address business issues.&lt;/li>&lt;li>Tailor transformation, organization design, and change management solutions for specific client situations and challenges and develop associated deliverables.&lt;/li>&lt;li>Promote the development of OCS colleagues through project work and professional experiences.&lt;/li>&lt;li>Identify and support initiatives to further develop the OCS practice (e.g., contributions to OCS knowledge management and best practices).&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;p>&lt;/p>&lt;p>&lt;b>&lt;i>&lt;b>&lt;i>Required Experience &amp;amp; Qualifications&lt;/i>&lt;/b>&lt;/i>&lt;/b>&lt;/p>&lt;p>&lt;/p>&lt;p>&lt;b>&lt;b>Key Skills &amp;amp; Knowledge:&lt;/b>&lt;/b>&lt;/p>&lt;ul>&lt;li>Ability to identify strategic priorities and direction in complex and ambiguous circumstances&lt;/li>&lt;li>Versatility to work across multiple subject matter domains and client groups&lt;/li>&lt;li>Excellent consultative, presentation, and facilitation skills&lt;/li>&lt;li>Superb problem solving skills; logical and analytical thinker&lt;/li>&lt;li>Strong executive presence&lt;/li>&lt;li>Proven teamwork capabilities; strong relationship management and interpersonal skills&lt;/li>&lt;li>Strong oral and written communication skills&lt;/li>&lt;li>Attentive to details and deadlines; ability to manage multiple initiatives&lt;/li>&lt;li>Strong project management, planning and organizational skills&lt;/li>&lt;li>Ability to effectively work independently and identify when to engage others&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;p>&lt;/p>&lt;p>&lt;b>&lt;b>Work Experience:&lt;/b>&lt;/b>&lt;/p>&lt;ul>&lt;li>Experience in one or more of the following specialties: strategy consulting, management consulting, large-scale transformations, global operating models, organizational design, organizational effectiveness and change management&lt;/li>&lt;li>Experience working closely with senior leadership&lt;/li>&lt;li>Experience in client service and consultation&lt;/li>&lt;li>Experience working with a global organization preferred&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;p>&lt;/p>&lt;p>&lt;b>&lt;b>Education/Certifications:&lt;/b>&lt;/b>&lt;/p>&lt;ul>&lt;li>Undergraduate degree or equivalent combination of training and experience&lt;/li>&lt;li>Advanced degree preferred&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;p>&lt;/p>&lt;p>&lt;b>&lt;b>Recent OCS Projects:&lt;/b>&lt;/b>&lt;/p>&lt;p>&lt;/p>&lt;p>&lt;u>IT Vision&lt;/u>: Help CIO consider how best to deliver enterprise-wide IT service to Vanguard’s global footprint.
